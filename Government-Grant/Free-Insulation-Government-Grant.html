<h2 id="1">How much insulation is already in your Cavity Walls?</h2>
<p>A grant of up to 25% can be claimed towards the cost of external wall insulation. Prices typically range from &pound;7,000 to &pound;15,000. Energylink can arrange a free survey and quote from an accredited local installer. Free external wall insulation is also available if you live in kw, iv or ph and do not have mains gas. External wall insulation is normally installed in properties that have solid brick or concrete walls. It can also be fitted to homes with cavity walls that are not suitable for cavity wall insulation.</p>
<p>Really want to start saving money on a monthly basis? then use this guide as your reference and locate the areas of your home that need upgrading to improve insulation and efficiency. There are a number of areas in your home where this is possible and as discussed, will include the windows, walls, loft, floor and boiler. If you want to invest in insulation that&rsquo;s not going to break the bank and will reward you almost immediately, cavity wall and loft insulation are perfect. With these in place you can instantly stop heat escaping your property and payback can be within just one year.</p>
<p>External wall insulation is also known as &ldquo;solid wall insulation&rdquo;, and sometimes just shortened to ewi. It is used to insulate houses that do not have cavity walls. These are usually older homes (pre-1920&rsquo;s), including many traditional terraced houses. If you are not sure what type of walls your house has, this article explains how to find out. External wall insulation is attached to the outside walls of a house, covered in several protective layers, and finished off with either render or another decorative finish.</p>
<p>Insulation: solid wall, cavity wall, under-floor, loft, flat roof, room in roof, park home. Low carbon heat: air source heat pump, ground source heat pump, solar thermal top ups are allowed (e. G. Additional loft insulation up to the recommended level, solid wall&nbsp;insulation for other walls where a wall has been previously insulated), but replacements are&nbsp;not included. You must do a primary measure to qualify for secondary measure funding.</p>
<p>Find out how to make your home more energy efficient and reduce your bills. The simple energy advice website has advice on ways to save energy , such as: insulating your loft and cavity walls draught-proofing windows and doors upgrading your boiler installing double glazing using alternative sources of energy, such as solar power you can also find out if you&rsquo;re eligible for a home energy grant to help pay for things like loft and cavity wall insulation.</p>
<h2 id="2">Is it more than 15 years since the cavity walls were filled?</h2>
<p>If your home has cavity walls, insulation can be fitted between the two layers of brickwork or between brick and breeze block. The material typically used by installers on the grant scheme is a shredded mineral wool (glass fibre). Small holes are drilled through the t joints in the mortar and the insulation is blown in. Once the cavity is filled to the correct density, the machine cuts off. The insulation must be installed from the bottom of the walls to the top so if you live in a flat, your neighbours above and/or below will also need insulation.</p>
<p>How long does it take to install cavity wall insulation? an averaged size property will take around two to three hours. Will i receive a guarantee? yes. The installer will apply for a 25 year guarantee through one of three organisations: ciga, kinnell or gdgc. How can i tell if my walls are already filled with cavity wall insulation? if you look closely, especially under the windows, you may be able to see where holes have been drilled and filled with cement. The holes are drilled where the mortar forms a t joint.</p>
<p>If your home was built after 1935 and the walls are at least 250mm thick, it probably has cavity walls. The gap between the inner and outer wall can be filled with insulation which could reduce your heat loss by up to 35% to save you money and keep you warmer. You may be able to tell if your cavity walls have already been filled by looking just under the centre of your window ledges, here you may find small drill holes around 2cm wide which then spread about around every 1 meter which would typically mean the work has already been completed. If there is no visible drill pattern and you believe your cavity walls need insulating, then please call us or complete our application form to arrange for a free insulation survey.</p>
<p>British gas is extending its offer of free loft and cavity wall insulation to all british households regardless of who supplies their energy. British gas is extending its offer of free loft and cavity wall insulation to all british households regardless of who supplies their energy. The new offer means that anyone owning a home with unfilled cavity walls or a loft with little or no insulation(1) can apply to british gas to install the measures for free. Households can cut up to &pound;175 off their heating bills every year by installing loft insulation and up to &pound;135 by installing cavity wall insulation(2).</p>
<p>If your home was built after the 1920s, chances are it&rsquo;s got cavity walls. And unless it was built within the last 20 years, those cavities are probably empty. If so, filling them with wall insulation could be a very cost-effective way to retain heat in your home and save on your energy bills. Around one third of the heat loss from most homes is through the walls, so cavity insulation could save you up to &pound;160 a year in heating bills1. In fact, according to figures from the energy saving trust website, cavity wall insulation could pay for itself within less than 5 years.</p>
<h3 id="3">Is at least 2/3 of your house made of Cavity Walls?</h3>
<p>About a third of all the heat lost in an uninsulated home escapes through the walls, so if you had a cavity wall insulation done in a detached house, you'd save up to &pound;260 on your energy bills per year, or you instead lived in semi-detached house, you'd save an average of &pound;155 compared to &pound;75 for a flat. This comes on a typical installation cost of &pound;720 for a semi-detached house, &pound;475 for a semi-detached house and &pound;330 for a flat.</p>
<p>Your installer should first check that the walls are suitable, in good condition and free from damp. They&rsquo;ll then drill a series of small holes, blow the insulation into the cavity using special equipment, and fill in the holes with mortar afterwards. A professional installer should be able to complete the work in around 2 hours for an average-sized house with easy-to-access walls. They should also &lsquo;make good&rsquo; when they&rsquo;ve finished &ndash; ie. Make sure you&rsquo;re not left with any mess!.</p>
<p>Cavity wall insulation is easier and cheaper to install than external wall insulation. Ewi is designed only for properties that either a) do not have cavity walls, or b) are &lsquo;hard to treat&rsquo; e. G. The cavities are too small to insulate. If your house has cavity walls that can be treated, then you won&rsquo;t qualify for free external wall insulation. If you&rsquo;re not sure what type of insulation you need, please get in touch with one of our energy surveyors.</p>
<p>Eligible households can apply to any participating energy firm - not just the home's supplier - to get a free home assessment. It's worth noting, however, that different energy providers have different eligibility criteria, and some offer home insulation while others are focused on boilers or other home energy efficiency measures. See below for further details. During a home assessment, your property will be examined to see what energy efficiency measures are already in place. New properties are generally well insulated, for example, but older homes may suffer from poor loft insulation and have cavity walls without any insulation installed.</p>
<p>Did you know that solid walls let twice as much heat escape as cavity walls? for a detached house, insulating solid walls could save you as much as &pound;455 a year. Read more in our guide to solid wall insulation.</p>
<h2 id="4">I receive an ECO qualifying benefit:</h2>
<p>What can i get? loft insulation, cavity wall insulation or a replacement a-rated gas boiler if yours is broken. Who is eligible? edf customers who either own their home or rent it privately and have an epc rating of a-e. You, or someone in your household, must also receive one of the qualifying benefits (see edf&rsquo;s website for the full list ).</p>
<p>The home heating cost reduction obligation requires energy suppliers to promote the installation of measures that lead to financial savings on energy bills, such as the installation of insulation and heating measures. You are eligible for eco if you are a core group customer from scheme year 9 onwards under the warm home discount scheme or you receive at least one of the following benefits and satisfy the relevant income requirements, where applicable:.</p>
<p>Without the help of a grant or funding, solid wall insulation can cost up to &pound;8000 &mdash; and often the people who need it the most are on lower incomes. Luckily there are grants available that cover 100% of the cost, if you receive certain benefits and/or live in a selected area. The gears scheme provides free external wall insulation for qualifying households &mdash; you can find out if you are eligible for gears here.</p>
<p>Homeowners or tenants who live in privately rented accommodation (and have permission from their landlord) are automatically eligible if someone in the household receives any following benefits: child benefit (subject to income) child tax credit income-related employment &amp; support allowance if you&rsquo;re not eligible for eco 3? local authority flexible eligibility grants and health grants are based on the same funding but you do not need to be on any of the benefits above. Each local authority council establishes the grant criteria for their area. Call or email us today and we will tell you if you would qualify for local funding.</p>
<p>Working tax credit child benefit dependant on income &amp; dependants if you do not fall into this category you are still likely to benefit from government funding, please enter your details in the insulation grant application form. The eco scheme legally requires the main energy suppliers to install energy efficient technologies such as cavity wall insulation and loft insulation to domestic households in the uk. If the energy suppliers fall short of their obligations they receive hefty fines.</p>
<h3 id="5">Take the first step to getting your free insulation.</h3>
<p>Lower your fuel bills get in touch with us to receive a free, one-to-one energy efficiency&nbsp;assessment.

<p>In 2012, the parliament of the uk approved the energy company obligation (eco). With the total budget increasing to &pound;1. 3 billion this year, the scheme is funded by the largest uk utility companies. Free loft and cavity wall insulation under eco is an initiative to reduce the uk's energy consumption by offering government funding to homes across england, scotland and wales. It provides grants to vulnerable households in order to help them improve the energy efficiency of their homes.</p>
<p>You may have heard about &lsquo;free insulation&rsquo; or &lsquo;fully-funded&rsquo; loft or cavity wall insulation through a government-backed scheme called eco (the energy company obligation scheme). It&rsquo;s been running over the past few years, but now things are about to change. The current eco grants will finish on 30th september 2018, and a new eco scheme will be brought into action from 1st october 2018.</p>
<p>More efficient ltd are still installing thousands of free loft, roof &amp; cavity wall insulations in homes all over scotland. Already this year we have completed over 1000 free insulation grants for scottish residents the majority of our work has been in glasgow &amp; greater glasgow. This year in particular we have started taking on more home insulation jobs in glasgow and have lots of case studies from happy glaswegians who now have warmer more efficient homes. Insulation jobs can be carried out free regardless where you are in scotland through the governments eco scheme. Below there&rsquo;s some more information for you to read which displays the different types of insulation available to help you decide which you think is more suitable for heating your home.</p>
<p>Insulation grants form an integral part of the governments eco scheme (energy company obligation) which was introduced in 2013. As part of the eu, the uk needs to reduce its housing stocks carbon emissions. Free cavity wall and loft insulation plays a major part in this and it's fully funded by the 'big six' energy suppliers. As long as you are a home owner, private tenant or landlord, you can apply for a free cavity wall or loft insulation grant. There is no charge, you do not have to re-pay the money back at any time and it is not to be confused with a 'green deal loan'.</p>
<p>More efficient ltd are still installing thousands of free loft, roof &amp; cavity wall insulations in homes all over scotland.
